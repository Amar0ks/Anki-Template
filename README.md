# Anki Sequence Of Questions

This card-template makes it possible to have multiple question for one answer. The question is chosen randomly. This could be very useful in different situations. For example if you want to learn to **recognize** a planet (see the example .apkg) or for math problems:

> Question:How many possibilities are there to arrange n objects in a row? // Anton, Berta, Casar have to line up one by one. How many possibilities are there?

> Answer: n!

You dont need any plugins. Therefore it should works everywhere.
